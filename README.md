ðŸš€ Hands-on CI/CD Pipeline with AWS EC2, Jenkins, Maven, and Apache Tomcat
I recently completed a hands-on project where I set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS EC2, Jenkins, Maven, and Apache Tomcat:
>>Provisioned EC2 instances:
One EC2 server for Jenkins.
Another EC2 server for Apache Tomcat.
>>Configured Jenkins to pull source code directly from GitHub.
>>Used Maven for compile, test, and package stages to generate the .war file in the target directory.
>>Installed and configured the Deploy to Container plugin in Jenkins to automate deployment to Tomcat.
>>Installed and configured Apache Tomcat 9.0.108 on the second EC2 instance, secured with username and password authentication.
>>Successfully deployed the packaged application from Jenkins to Tomcat using the Tomcat serverâ€™s public IP.
